        <h4>Section Heading</h4>
        <p>An article can have zero or more sections.  A section can contain zero or more articles.  So, <strong>what is the difference?</strong></p>

        <h4>Progressive Enhancement</h4>
        <p>Progressive enhancement (PE) is a strategy for web design that emphasizes 
        <mark title="Define what is accessibility">accessibility</mark>, semantic HTML markup, and external stylesheet and scripting technologies. PE consists of a set of core principles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>basic content should be accessible to all web browsers</li>
            <li>basic functionality should be accessible to all web browsers</li>
            <li>sparse, semantic markup contains all content</li>
            <li>enhanced layout is provided by externally linked CSS</li>
            <li>enhanced behavior is provided by unobtrusive, externally linked JavaScript</li>
            <li>end-user web browser preferences are respected</li>
        </ol>

        <p>You can generate Latin text from sites such as the lipsum.com site.  Why is it better than using the current language, such as English?  Here are a couple of paragraphs generated on <a href="" target="_blank">lipsum.com</a> and an image too!</p>
